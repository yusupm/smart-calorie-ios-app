## Disclaimer:
This is a project I have done for my final year project of Bachelor's degree. When I first started this project, I had close to no knowledge in Swift programming. This whole project is like my Swift playground â€“ where I tried, learned, messed up, and improved.

## App description:
Smart Calories, the iOS app that utilizes cutting-edge AI technology to detect food names in pictures and provide you with accurate calorie information. With this app, you can easily track your calorie intake by simply taking a photo of your meal. 

## Project dependencies:
